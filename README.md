# Suvidha

## Getting the Sources
First, fork the Suvidha repository so that you can make a pull request. Then, clone your fork locally: 
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-github-account]/Suvidha.git 
```

Occasionally you will want to merge changes in the upstream repository (the official code repo) with your fork.
```
cd Suvidha
git checkout master
git pull https://github.com/devsebastian/Suvidha.git master
```
Manage any merge conflicts, commit them, and then push them to your fork.

```
Just run the code in android studio.
```
